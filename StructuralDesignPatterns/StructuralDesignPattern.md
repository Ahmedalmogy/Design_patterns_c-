Structural design patterns are a group of design patterns in object-oriented programming that focus on how classes and objects can be composed to form larger structures. They aim to achieve the following goals:

Increased flexibility and reusability: By defining clear relationships and interfaces between classes, you can create more flexible and reusable code components.
Improved maintainability: Separating concerns and well-defined structures make code easier to understand, modify, and extend.
Enhanced performance: Some structural patterns can optimize memory usage or object creation overhead in specific scenarios.
Here are some of the most common structural design patterns:

Adapter Pattern: This pattern allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate. It acts as a "wrapper" that translates calls between incompatible interfaces.

Bridge Pattern: This pattern separates the abstraction (what) from the implementation (how). It decouples an interface from its implementation, allowing for independent changes to each.

Composite Pattern: This pattern enables you to treat individual objects and compositions of objects (hierarchies) in a uniform way. You can build complex tree-like structures where both leaves (individual objects) and composites (branches) can be treated similarly.

Decorator Pattern: This pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. It provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for adding new functionalities.

Facade Pattern: This pattern simplifies a complex subsystem by providing a single point of entry. It hides the complexities of the underlying components and offers a more manageable interface for clients to interact with.

Flyweight Pattern: This pattern minimizes memory usage and improves performance by sharing common state between similar objects. It's particularly useful when dealing with a large number of objects with a lot of shared data.

Proxy Pattern: This pattern provides a substitute or placeholder for another object. It can control access to the original object, adding functionalities like security or lazy loading.
